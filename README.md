# libwebuy
This PHP library served as an implementation for CeX's old [wss2.cex.uk.webuy.io/v3](https://wss2.cex.uk.webuy.io/v3/) API.
The wss2 API has now been deprecated and decomissioned, thus being no longer accessible.

This library is not usable anymore, and is made available for historical purposes.

### Requirements
